Hi, My name is Said Al Faraby, and please check out my hometown, [_Lingga Island_](https://goo.gl/maps/36id6WTC1Re78Aa87), and see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RccFBOxYHs)

#### Education
I received M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from University of Amsterdam in 2015 under supervision of [Ted Meeds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedmeeds/). Before that I completed my B.Sc in Informatics from Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia.

While doing my master, I had a chance to work as research assistant (March 2014 - Feb 2015) in Data Science Research Center Amsterdam, working with Ted Meeds on a project called [“Machine Learning in the Browser”](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-11/). In the summer 2014 (July - Oct), I also did internship at [Booking.com](booking.com) and was advised by [Thanasis Noulas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noulas/) and [Frans Oliehoek](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fao/).

#### Working Experience
Since 2015, I've been working at School of Computing, [Telkom University](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id/) as lecturer, mainly teach Basic Algorithm and Programming, Machine Learning, Intro to NLP. I'm also a member of [Intelligence, Computing, and Multimedia](https://icm.rg.telkomuniversity.ac.id/) Research Group. Besides teaching I had a series of second appointment, at Student Affairs unit, Informatics Study Program, and now at the University Secretariat.

#### Miscellaneous
In my spare time I like to play with my kids (so far 2), I also try to read books, mostly non-fiction and self-help books ([my reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9265112?shelf=read))
. At weekends, I do [bicycling](
